      The muscles of the leg are divided into four main groups: the quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors, and the calf muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quadriceps are a group of four muscles located in the front of the thigh that work together to extend the knee. The rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and vastus intermedius are the four muscles that make up the quadriceps group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hamstrings are a group of three muscles located in the back of the thigh that work together to flex the knee and extend the hip. The biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus are the three muscles that make up the hamstrings group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adductors are a group of muscles located in the inner thigh that work together to bring the thigh towards the midline of the body. The adductor magnus, adductor longus, adductor brevis and gracilis are the muscles that make up the adductors group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calf muscles are located in the back of the lower leg and include the gastrocnemius and the soleus. These muscles work together to plantar flex the foot (point the toes) and also help in knee flexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these muscles work together to allow for movement of the legs and support the body weight, They are also important for activities such as walking, running, jumping, and climbing stairs, as well as many sports that require leg strength and power.
