      The muscles of the shoulder are responsible for a wide range of movements, including lifting, pushing, pulling, and rotating the arm. The main muscles that make up the shoulder include:
    </p>
    <p>
      The deltoids: This muscle group is located on the upper part of the shoulder and is responsible for lifting the arm up and out to the side. It's composed of three parts: the anterior (front), medial (middle) and posterior (rear) deltoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rotator cuff muscles: This group of muscles is made up of four muscles: the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. These muscles work together to stabilize the shoulder joint and allow for smooth movement of the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pectoralis major and minor: These muscles are located in the chest and help to lift and rotate the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latissimus dorsi: This muscle is located in the back and is responsible for pulling the arm down and back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trapezius: This muscle is located in the upper back and is responsible for lifting the shoulder blades and rotating the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biceps and triceps: These muscles are located in the upper arm, the biceps are responsible for flexing the elbow and the triceps are responsible for extending the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these muscles work together to allow for a wide range of movements in the shoulder, and to provide support and stability to the shoulder joint. Strong shoulders can help to improve posture and can also play a role in preventing injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also important to note that the shoulder is a complex joint, and any injury or pain in the shoulder should be evaluated by a medical professional. In order to prevent injury, it's important to maintain balance in the shoulder muscles by working on both the pushing and pulling exercises.
