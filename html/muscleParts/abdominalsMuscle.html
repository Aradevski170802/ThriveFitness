      The abdominal muscles, also known as the abs, are a group of muscles located in the front and sides of the torso that provide support to the spine and help to protect the internal organs. The main muscles of the abdominal region include:
    </p>
    <p>
      Rectus abdominis: This muscle runs vertically along the front of the abdomen and is responsible for flexing the spine. It is often referred to as the "six-pack muscle" due to the distinct lines that can form along the muscle when it is well-defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      External oblique: These muscles are located on the sides of the abdomen and are responsible for rotation and lateral flexion of the spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internal oblique: These muscles are located just beneath the external oblique and also assist in rotation and lateral flexion of the spine.
    </p>    
    <p>
      Transversus abdominis: This muscle is located deep within the abdomen and acts as a corset, providing support to the spine and helping to stabilize the trunk during movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The erector spinae: This group of muscle runs along the back, and it is responsible for extension, lateral flexion, and rotation of the spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these muscles work together to provide stability and support to the spine, as well as helping to power movements such as bending and twisting. Strong abs can also help to improve posture, and can also play a role in preventing back pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also important to note that exercises that primarily target the abdominal muscles and should be combined with exercises that target the back muscles to maintain balance and prevent injury.
