          Muscles are the tissues in the body that enable movement and generate heat. They are composed of specialized cells called muscle fibers, which contract and relax to produce movement.
          There are three types of muscles in the body:

      <p>
        Skeletal muscles are the muscles that are attached to the bones and are responsible for movement of the body and maintenance of posture. They are under voluntary control, meaning we can consciously control their movement.
        Cardiac muscles are found in the heart and are responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. They are involuntary, meaning we do not have conscious control over their movement.
        Smooth muscles are found in the walls of internal organs and blood vessels. They are also involuntary and play a role in the movement of food through the digestive system and the contraction of blood vessels.
        Muscles are supplied by nerves which allow the brain to send signals to the muscle to move or contract. The muscle fibers are supplied by blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscle fibers which are required to produce energy.

        Muscles can be trained by performing exercises that put them under stress, which causes them to adapt and grow stronger. This process is called muscle hypertrophy.

        It is important to engage in regular physical activity and a balanced workout routine that includes exercises that target multiple muscle groups for overall fitness and health. It is also important to engage in proper form and to use a weight that is appropriate for your fitness level when performing exercises in order to avoid injury.
