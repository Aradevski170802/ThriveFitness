      The biceps muscle is located in the front of the upper arm and is responsible for flexing the elbow, as well as supinating the forearm (turning the palm up). The biceps muscle is made up of two heads: the short head and the long head. The short head originates at the coracoid process of the scapula (shoulder blade), while the long head originates at the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. Both heads insert on the radius bone of the forearm. The biceps muscle is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve.

      The biceps muscle is a commonly trained muscle in weightlifting and bodybuilding, and can be worked through exercises such as bicep curls, hammer curls, and pull-ups. Strong biceps can also help with everyday activities such as lifting and carrying heavy objects. It's also important to note that bicep muscle also work along with brachialis and brachioradialis for elbow flexion and forearm supination.
